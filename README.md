Market Basket Analysis – Apriori Algorithm
📌 Overview

This project explores customer purchasing patterns using Market Basket Analysis. By applying the Apriori algorithm on a groceries dataset, the project uncovers relationships between products that are often bought together.

Retailers use this technique to:

Place complementary items next to each other in stores

Build personalized product recommendations

Optimize promotions and inventory

For me, this project was an opportunity to combine data preprocessing, algorithm implementation, and visualization into a complete workflow that demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into business insights.

🔑 Key Highlights

Cleaned and transformed a transactional groceries dataset into a customer–item matrix.

Applied the Apriori algorithm to identify frequent itemsets.

Generated association rules with support, confidence, and lift metrics.

Created simple but effective visualizations to present results clearly.

Documented the code with explanations for better readability.

🗂 Dataset

Source: Groceries dataset (Groceries_dataset.csv)

Each row represents a transaction, listing items purchased by a customer.

Used to simulate real-world market basket scenarios.

⚙️ Setup Instructions

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/market-basket-analysis.git
cd market-basket-analysis


Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the notebook:

jupyter notebook Annotated_Notebook.ipynb


If using Google Colab, simply upload the dataset when prompted.

📊 Sample Results

Frequent Itemset Example:
{milk, bread} → support = 5%

Association Rule Example:
milk → bread

Confidence: 72%

Lift: 1.35

These numbers reflect how strongly items are related and can be used for cross-selling strategies.

💼 Business Impact

Market Basket Analysis directly impacts how a company approaches sales, marketing, and customer experience.

📈 Increased Sales: By recommending items frequently bought together, companies can encourage higher basket values.

🏬 Smarter Store Layouts: Placing related products side by side leads to impulse purchases.

🎯 Targeted Promotions: Discounts can be applied to bundles of products that customers often buy together.

📦 Optimized Inventory: Understanding demand patterns helps reduce stockouts and overstock.

In short, this analysis provides actionable insights that translate into revenue growth and better customer satisfaction—which is why it is widely used in retail and e-commerce.

🌟 Why This Project Matters to Recruiters

This project demonstrates:

End-to-end data handling, from raw input to insights.

The ability to apply machine learning beyond predictive modeling.

A focus on business value, not just technical implementation.

It highlights my ability to think beyond code—understanding why the analysis matters to companies and how it influences decision-making.

🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a Mechanical Engineering student with a strong interest in data science, machine learning, and automation. While my background is in engineering, I actively explore how AI and analytics can solve real-world problems—this project being one example.

I’m eager to bring this combination of analytical thinking and practical coding skills into challenging roles where data is central to business strategy.
