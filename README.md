#  Product Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing customer purchase behavior and marketing campaign effectiveness using a retail dataset. The goal is to extract insights that can guide business strategy, customer segmentation, and marketing efforts.


##  Project Structure
- **product_analysis.ipynb** → Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis (data cleaning, EDA, segmentation).
- **figures/** → Folder where generated charts and visualizations are saved.
- **dataset/** → The dataset used for analysis (CSV file).


##  Key Steps in the Analysis
1. **Setup & Configuration**  
   - Import required Python libraries.  
   - Set up file paths and visualization defaults.  

2. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
   - Load dataset (CSV format).  
   - Clean column names, handle missing values, and format dates.  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Create new columns like total spending, purchase frequency, and campaign responses.  

4. **Key KPIs**  
   - Calculate important business metrics such as average income, average spend, and campaign acceptance rate.  

5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution of spending.  
   - Average spend by education and marital status.  
   - Income vs. spending relationship.  
   - Channel usage comparison.  

6. **Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis)**  
   - Divide customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value.  
   - Identify high-value and at-risk customer groups.  

7. **Conclusions & Insights**  
   - Business takeaways from KPIs and EDA.  
   - Suggestions for campaign targeting and customer engagement.  


## Tools & Libraries
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  

##  How to Run
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Place the dataset in the project folder.  
3. Open `product_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.  
4. Run the cells in order to reproduce the analysis.  


## Notes
- This project is meant for **learning and demonstration purposes**.  
- The dataset is anonymized and used only for analysis practice.  
- Insights drawn are **illustrative** and may not represent real business decisions.
